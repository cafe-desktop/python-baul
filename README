libbaul-extension python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the baul extension library.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

As of python-baul 1.5.0, scripts are loaded only from $XDG_DATA_DIR/baul-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Requirements
============

Caja      1.17.1
Python    3.6
PyGObject 3.0.0

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting baul. That's a planned feature for future versions.
